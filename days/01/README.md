# Day 1

URL: https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1

## Task
* _part1_: read 2 arrays from the input file, sort them, subtract the differences and then sum these for the answer.
* _part2_: find how many times a number from the first list is in the second, multiply that with the number from the first list and then sum these numbers.

## Solution
I have 2 solutions
* one in a [spreadsheet](excel) with just a few functions (most time of this was downloading libreoffice).
* and one in [bash](bash). _No input validation is done!_ Interestingly part2 was much easier.\
Invocation: 
    * _part1_: `./day1part1.sh ../input`
    * _part2_: `./day1part2.sh ../input`
