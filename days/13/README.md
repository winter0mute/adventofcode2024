## Task
* _part1_: Get the minimal value of movements that satisfies the prise value ie: do some A and some B movements, add the values together and if those match the prize values then then the combination is valid, the value of this combination is tree times the A buttons pressed and one times the B button pressed added together.
* _part2_: We don't have the restriction to find a valid movement combination after 100 button presses but the prize should be increased by 10000000000000.

## Solution
* _part1_: `./day13part1.js input`
* _part2_: `./day13part2.js input`
