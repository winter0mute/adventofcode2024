## Task
* _part1_: Get the position of the robots and apply the velocities 100 times (they wrap around the map edges of the map). Then the middle row and columns of the map should be discarded and the robots in the 4 quadrants that the middle row and column creates should be counted. The result is the number of robots in each quadrant multiplied together.
* _part2_: TBD

## Solution
* _part1_: TBD
