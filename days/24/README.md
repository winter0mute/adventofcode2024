# Day 24

## Task
* _part1_: Using the first known values from the first half work out the values of logic gate equations in the second half. The solution is the decimal value of the `z*` values sorted descending.
* _part2_: I know that the second part is related to Half and Full Adders but will need some research into these to know how these could help to solve _part2_.

## Solution
* _part1_: `./day24part1.sh input`\
I would say this was pretty straightforward just needed to pay close attention to details (like the z wires should be sorted backwards ie. `z00` is the most significant).
* _part2_: TBD
